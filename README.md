# 🚀 AI-Enhanced ML-FAANG Mastery Plan

A comprehensive 20-week learning management system for ML researchers transitioning to FAANG software engineering roles, featuring an interactive web application with AI integration.

## ✨ 2024 Website Upgrade ✨

This project has undergone a significant upgrade in July 2024 to improve maintainability, performance, and user experience. The following enhancements have been implemented:

*   **Codebase Refactoring**: The original monolithic `index.html` has been refactored into separate HTML, CSS (`style.css`), and JavaScript (`script.js`) files. This improves code organization and maintainability.
*   **Link Verification**: A comprehensive link audit was performed using a custom Python script (`link_verifier.py`). All `neetcode.io` links were verified as active, while `leetcode.com` links returned a `403 Forbidden` status, indicating a potential access issue for programmatic verification.
*   **Accessibility Audit**: An accessibility audit was conducted using `axe-core`. Issues were identified, and attempts were made to fix them. However, due to limitations with the development environment's file editing tools, some issues could not be fully resolved.
*   **SEO Improvements**: The website's SEO has been enhanced by adding descriptive meta tags (title, description, keywords) and Open Graph/Twitter card information. A `sitemap.xml` has also been created.

## 🤖 **Auto-Deployment Status**

✅ **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Automatically deploys to both platforms  
✅ **Multi-Platform Sync**: GitHub Pages + Netlify stay in sync  
✅ **Clean Deployment**: Only app files deployed (no development clutter)  
✅ **Production Ready**: All critical issues resolved

**Deployment Trigger**: Every push to `main` branch → Auto-deploys in ~30 seconds

## 🎯 Quick Start

### 1. Interactive App (Local)
The new version of the app requires Node.js.

```bash
cd app/
npm install
node a11y_audit.js # This will also start a local server
# Open http://localhost:PORT in browser (port will be logged to console)
```

Alternatively, you can still use a simple Python server if you don't need the audit functionality:
```bash
cd app/
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Open http://localhost:8000 in browser
```

### 2. Deploy to Web
The `app/` folder is ready for deployment to:
- **GitHub Pages**: Push `app/` contents to `gh-pages` branch
- **Netlify**: Drag `app/` folder to netlify.com/drop  
- **Vercel**: Connect repo and set root directory to `app/`
