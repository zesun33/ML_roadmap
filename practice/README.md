# Practice Directory Structure

This directory contains all your practice code, notes, and solutions for the ML-FAANG Mastery Plan.

## Organization

### By Week (`weeks/`)
- Each week has its own folder (week-01 through week-20)
- Contains daily session notes and problem solutions
- Progress tracking for each week

### By Topic (`topics/`)
- Organized by algorithm/data structure categories
- Arrays & Hashing, Two Pointers, Trees, etc.
- Cross-references with Neetcode 150 problems

### By Language (`languages/`)
- Python solutions (primary)
- JavaScript solutions (optional)
- SQL solutions (for data engineering prep)

### Notes (`notes/`)
- Weekly retrospectives
- AI-generated explanations and insights
- Mock interview feedback
- ML system design notes

### Code (`code/`)
- Implementation templates
- Custom data structures
- Utility functions and helpers

## Usage

1. Each problem solution should include:
   - Problem statement and approach
   - Time/space complexity analysis
   - AI-generated explanation connecting to ML concepts
   - Multiple solution approaches where applicable

2. Weekly folders track daily progress:
   - Morning session notes
   - Coding session solutions
   - Evening session ML system study notes

3. Use the templates provided in `templates/` for consistency

## File Naming Convention

- Problem solutions: `problem-name.py` (kebab-case)
- Notes: `topic-notes.md` or `week-XX-day-X.md`
- Templates: `template-[type].py`

## Progress Tracking

- Update progress in weekly README files
- Track completion status in the main app
- Regular retrospectives in notes/retrospectives/
